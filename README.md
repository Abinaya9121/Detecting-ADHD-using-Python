# Detecting-ADHD-using-Python
Machine learning project used to detect ADHD based on the given ADHD and Control text dataset. 
Performed data pre-processing and data visualizations using Topoplot. 
Many Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms were used to build the model and compared all the models using different evaluation metrics.
Predictions were performed by choosing the best model out of all models.
